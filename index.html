                How COVID 19 SPREADS
            </h1>
            <p class="paragraphheading">
                People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.<br>
                The disease can spread from person to person through small<br>
                 droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person<br>
                  with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects<br>
                   and surfaces around the person.
